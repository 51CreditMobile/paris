# Paris
Programmatic style application for Android views, including custom attributes.

* Apply styles programmatically at any time, in addition to XML
* Use annotations to easily support custom attributes (inspired by [Barber](https://github.com/hzsweers/barber))
* Declare explicitly supported styles for your custom views
