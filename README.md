# Paris
Programmatic style creation and application for Android views, including custom attributes.

* Apply styles programmatically at any time
* Create styles programmatically (as opposed to using XML)
* Use annotations to easily support custom attributes (inspired by [Barber](https://github.com/hzsweers/barber))
* Declare explicitly supported styles for your custom views
